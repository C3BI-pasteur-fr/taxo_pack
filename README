All programs permit to analyze and visualize the taxonomic abundance of set of sequences compared against a sequence database with BLAST.

First, taxoptimizer.py parse the blast output report and add the NCBI Taxonomy database information to each HSP. It requires the bsddb python library
(https://docs.python.org/2/library/bsddb.html), the Berkeley DB library (http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db) and the Golden program
(https://github.com/C3BI-pasteur-fr/golden) to work.

And, rankoptimizer.py analyze the taxonomy abundance of a set of sequences, pre-process by the taxoptimizer.py program, and format result with Krona,
an interactive metagenomic visualization in a Web browser (https://github.com/marbl/Krona). 

Finaly, kronaextract.py extract sub-list of Query ID from a set of sequences matching a given taxon name and/or their offset number in the rankoptimizer.py output.
